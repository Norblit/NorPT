# NorPT

### Project Description:
NorPT is an integration between OpenAI's ChatGPT and Discord's bot system. The aim of this project is to provide a way to use ChatGPT without having to open a browser, by integrating it with Discord's application. In addition, I have included a library that allows users to listen to any song on Discord, making it a well-rounded bot with multiple functions. As someone who uses Discord frequently, I plan to continue adding features to this bot. It is currently hosted on Oracle's cloud servers, where it is closely monitored and running smoothly.

**Code will be posted soon.**
